Fizzbuzz Style Gide
===================

I love FizzBuzz :).

Rule
====

* Input program integer each number from 1 to 100
  * if n can be devided by 3, output "Fizz"
  * if n can be devided by 5, output "Buzz"
  * if n can be devided by 15, output "FizzBuzz"
  * other, output n.

Test
====

* Answer file is /answer.txt
* Test way is as following.
  1. cd directory_to_targe (e.g. "cd Ruby")
  2. make (It makes .out files)
  3. make test (It compares .out files with answer.txt)

Requirements
============
C++
---
```
yum -y install gcc gcc-c++ boost boost-thread boost-devel
```
